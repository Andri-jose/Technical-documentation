                <p>This part of the tutorial is about core JavaScript, the language itself.
                But we need a working environment to run our scripts and, since this book is online, the browser is a 
                good choice. We’ll keep the amount of browser-specific commands (like alert) to a minimum so that you
                don’t spend time on them if you plan to concentrate on another environment (like Node.js). We’ll
                focus on JavaScript in the browser in the next part of the tutorial.</p>
                <p>So first, let’s see how we attach a script to a webpage. For server-side environments (like Node.js), 
                you can execute the script with a command like "node my.js".</p>
                <p>The “script” tag
                JavaScript programs can be inserted almost anywhere into an HTML document using the script tag.</p>
                <p>For instance:</p>
                <p><code>script<br>
                alert( 'Hello, world!' );<br>
                /script</code></p>
                <p>You can run the example by clicking the “Play” button in the right-top corner of the box above.
                The script tag contains JavaScript code which is automatically executed when the browser processes the tag.</p>

                <h2 class="title">Code Structure</h2>
            </header>
            <article>
                <p>The first thing we’ll study is the building blocks of code.</p>
                <h3>Statements</h3>
                <p>Statements are syntax constructs and commands that perform actions.
                We’ve already seen a statement, alert('Hello, world!'), which shows the message “Hello, world!”.
                We can have as many statements in our code as we want. Statements can be separated with a semicolon.
                For example, here we split “Hello World” into two alerts:</p>
                <p><code>('Hello'); alert('World');</code>
                Usually, statements are written on separate lines to make the code more readable:</p>
                <p><code>alert('Hello');
                alert('World');</code>
                Semicolons
                A semicolon may be omitted in most cases when a line break exists.</p>
                <p>This would also work:</p>
                <p><code>alert('Hello')
                alert('World')</code>
                Here, JavaScript interprets the line break as an “implicit” semicolon. This is called an automatic
                semicolon insertion.
                In most cases, a newline implies a semicolon. But “in most cases” does not mean “always”!</p>
                <p>There are cases when a newline does not mean a semicolon. For example:</p>
                <p><code>(3 +1+ 2);</code></p>
                <p>The code outputs 6 because JavaScript does not insert semicolons here. It is intuitively obvious 
                that if the line ends with a plus "+", then it is an “incomplete expression”, so a semicolon there 
                would be incorrect. And in this case, that works as intended.
                But there are situations where JavaScript “fails” to assume a semicolon where it is really needed.</p>

            <article>
                <p>For a long time, JavaScript evolved without compatibility issues. New features were added to the language 
                while old functionality didn’t change.
                That had the benefit of never breaking existing code. But the downside was that any mistake or an imperfect 
                decision made by JavaScript’s creators got stuck in the language forever.</p>
                <p>This was the case until 2009 when ECMAScript 5 (ES5) appeared. It added new features to the language and
                modified some of the existing ones. To keep the old code working, most such modifications are off by default. 
                You need to explicitly enable them with a special directive: "use strict".</p>
                <p>“use strict”
                The directive looks like a string: "use strict" or 'use strict'. When it is located at the top of a script,
                the whole script works the “modern” way.</p>
                <p>For example:</p>
                <p>"use strict";</p>
                <p>// this code works the modern way</p>

            </header>
            <article>
                <p>Most of the time, a JavaScript application needs to work with information. Here are two examples:</p>
                <p>An online shop – the information might include goods being sold and a shopping cart.
                A chat application – the information might include users, messages, and much more.
                Variables are used to store this information.</p>
                <p>A variable</p>
                <p>A variable is a “named storage” for data. We can use variables to store goodies, visitors, and other data.</p>
                <p>To create a variable in JavaScript, use the let keyword.
                The statement below creates (in other words: declares) a variable with the name “message”:</p>
                <p>let message;</p>
                <p>Now, we can put some data into it by using the assignment operator =:</p>
                <p>let message;</p>
                <p>message = 'Hello'; // store the string 'Hello' in the variable named message</p>
            </article>

        <section class="main-section" id="Data_types">
            <header>
                <h2 class="title">Data types</h2>
            </header>
            <article>
                <P>A value in JavaScript is always of a certain type. For example, a string or a number.
                There are eight basic data types in JavaScript. Here, we’ll cover them in general and in the next chapters we’ll talk about each of them in detail.
                We can put any type in a variable. For example, a variable can at one moment be a string and then store a number:</P>
                <p><code>>// no error<br>
                let message = "hello";<br>
                message = 123456;</code></p>
                <p>Programming languages that allow such things, such as JavaScript, are called “dynamically typed”, meaning that
                there exist data types, but variables are not bound to any of them.</p>
                <p><code>
                let n = 123;<br>
                n = 12.345;</code></p>
                <p>The number type represents both integer and floating point numbers.</p>
                <p>There are many operations for numbers, e.g. multiplication *, division /, addition +, subtraction -, and so on.
                Besides regular numbers, there are so-called “special numeric values” which also belong to this data type: 
                Infinity, -Infinity and NaN.
                Infinity represents the mathematical Infinity ∞. It is a special value that’s greater than any number.
                We can get it as a result of division by zero:</p>
                <p>alert( 1 / 0 ); // Infinity</p>
                <p>The latest ECMAScript standard defines seven data types:</p>
			    <ul>
			    	<li>
			    	    <p>Six data types that are primitives:</p>
			    		<ul>
			    			<li>
			    				<p>Boolean. true and false.</p>
			    			</li>
			    			<li>
			    				<p>null. A special keyword denoting a null value. Because JavaScript is case-sensitive, null
			    				is not the same as Null, NULL, or any other variant.</p>
			    			</li>
			    			<li>
			    				<p>undefined. A top-level property whose value is undefined.</p>
			    			</li>
			    			<li>
			    				<p>Number. 42 or 3.14159.</p>
			    			</li>
			    			<li>
			    				<p>String. "Howdy"</p>
			    			</li>
			    			<li>
			    				<p>Symbol (new in ECMAScript 2015). A data type whose instances are unique and
			    				immutable.</p>
			    			</li>
			    			<li>
			    				<p>and Object</p>
			    			</li>
			    		</ul>
			    	</li>
			    </ul>

            </header>
            <article>
                <p>>As we’ll be using the browser as our demo environment, let’s see a couple of functions to interact with 
                the user: alert, prompt and confirm.</p>
                <p>alert<br>
                This one we’ve seen already. It shows a message and waits for the user to press “OK”.</p>
                <p><code> example:<br>
                alert("Hello")</code></p>
                The mini-window with the message is called a modal window. The word “modal” means that the visitor 
                can’t interact with the rest of the page, press other buttons, etc, until they have dealt with the window. 
                In this case – until they press “OK”.</p>
                <p>Prompt<br>
                The function prompt accepts two arguments:</p>
                <p>result = prompt(title, [default]);</p>
                <p>It shows a modal window with a text message, an input field for the visitor, and the buttons OK/Cancel.</p>
                <p>Title<br>      
                The text to show the visitor.</p>  
                <p>default<br>
                An optional second parameter, the initial value for the input field</p>

                <h2 class="title">Type Conversions</h2>
            </header>
            <article>
                <p>Most of the time, operators and functions automatically convert the values given to them to the right type.
                For example, alert automatically converts any value to a string to show it. Mathematical operations 
                convert values to numbers.
                There are also cases when we need to explicitly convert a value to the expected type.
                Not talking about objects yet
                In this chapter, we won’t cover objects. For now we’ll just be talking about primitives.
                Later, after we learn about objects, in the chapter Object to primitive conversion we’ll see how 
                objects fit in.
                String Conversion
                String conversion happens when we need the string form of a value.
                For example, alert(value) does it to show the value.
                We can also call the String(value) function to convert a value to a string:</p>
                <p>let value = true;<br>
                alert(typeof value); // boolean</p>
                <p>>value = String(value); // now value is a string "true"<br>
                alert(typeof value); // string</p>

            <header>
                <h2 class="title">Basic operators</h2>
            </header>
            <article>
                <p>We know many operators from school. They are things like addition +, multiplication *, subtraction -, 
                and so on.</p>
                <p>In this chapter, we’ll start with simple operators, then concentrate on JavaScript-specific aspects, 
                not covered by school arithmetic.</p>
                <p>Terms: “unary”, “binary”, “operand”
                Before we move on, let’s grasp some common terminology.</p>
                <p>>An operand – is what operators are applied to. For instance, in the multiplication of 5 * 2 there are 
                two operands: the left operand is 5 and the right operand is 2. Sometimes, people call these “arguments” 
                instead of “operands”.</p>
                <p>An operator is unary if it has a single operand. For example, the unary negation - reverses the sign of
                 a number:</p>
                <p><code>let x = 1;<br>
                     x = -x;<br>
                alert( x ); // -1, unary negation was applied</code></p>
                <p>An operator is binary if it has two operands. The same minus exists in binary 
                form as well:</p>
                <p>let x = 1, y = 3;<br>
                alert( y - x ); // 2, binary minus subtracts values<br>
                Formally, in the examples above we have two different operators that share the same symbol: the negation
                operator, a unary operator that reverses the sign, and the subtraction operator, a binary operator that 
                subtracts one number from another.</p>
            </article>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Functions">
            <header>
                <h2 class="title">Functions</h2>
            </header>
            <article>
                <p>Quite often we need to perform a similar action in many places of the script.</p>
                <p>For example, we need to show a nice-looking message when a visitor logs in, logs out and maybe somewhere else.
                Functions are the main “building blocks” of the program. They allow the code to be called many times without 
                repetition.</p>
                <p>We’ve already seen examples of built-in functions, like alert(message), prompt(message, default) and
                confirm(question). But we can create functions of our own as well.</p>
                <p>Function Declaration
                To create a function we can use a function declaration.</p>
                <p> It looks like this:</p>
                <p><code>function showMessage() {<br>
                            alert( 'Hello everyone!' );
                }</code></p>
                <p>The function keyword goes first, then goes the name of the function, then a list of parameters between 
                the parentheses (comma-separated, empty in the example above, we’ll see examples later) and finally the
                 code of the function, also named “the function body”, between curly braces.</p>
                <p>function name(parameter1, parameter2, ... parameterN) <br>
                  ...body...
                }</p>
                Our new function can be called by its name: showMessage().</p>
                <p><code>For instance:<br>
                function showMessage() {<br>
                  alert( 'Hello everyone!' );
                }</code></p>
                <p><code>showMessage();<br>
                            showMessage();</code></p>
